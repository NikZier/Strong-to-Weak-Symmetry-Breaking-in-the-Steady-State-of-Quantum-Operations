Circuit_simulation.py: A direct simulation of the circuit that computes the time dependence of the Fidelity and Rényi-2 correlators. Data is found in data\\direct_simulations\\Renyi_and_Fidelity. The data in the folder was obtained using the following set of parameters:

L=4
p=0.5
J=U=1
Nt=400
interations=10e4

MPO_functions: contains several functions to manipulate matrix product operators (MPO) and is used in notebooks\\Renyi-m_correlators.ipynb

notebooks:

Ising_exact.ipynb: Exact diagonalization of the transverse field Ising model (TFI) to compute Renyi and Fidelity correlators. Generates training data for the neural network in Renyi-m_correlators.ipynb

Renyi-m_correlators.ipynb: Calculates the Renyi-m correlators from the groundstate MPS of the 2-copy Ising model. Also trains a neural network to learn the Fidelity

S3_DMRG_simulation.ipynb: DMRG simulation to find the groundstate of the 2-copy S3 Potts model

Z2_DMRG_simulation.ipynb: DMRG simulation to find the groundstate of the 2-copy Ising model
